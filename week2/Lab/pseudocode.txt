The operation is split into two steps:
Step1 is to calculating the score of the word for each player.
Step2 is to compare the 2 scores for evaluating who's won.

Step1:
How to calculate the score?

For example the word "Code" like in the example; a string is an array of
characters and each character have a point.

To extract the characters is by indexing and iterating over the string from 0 to
the length of the variable strlen(word1):
word[0] = C;
word[1] = o;
word[2] = d;
word[3] = e;

* Character's that are not letters should be given zero points:

Function to calculate the score:

int score = 0;

int arr[26];
init arr;

int ARR[26];
init ARR;

 for (int i = 0; i < strleng(word); i++)
 {
 int point = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++)
    {
        if ((int) word[i] == arr[j] || word[i] == ARR[j])
        {
          point = points[j];
        }
    }
       score += point;
  }
  return score;


So if the character is not in the array of uppercase or lowercase the given
point will be 0.

If the character number when we cast it == a number in the array of letters
the score will be the correspondant point in the array points.

And in each iteration of the POINTS[i] the score will be the sum of the
elements of the array..

Every letter can be in upper or lower case, by checking if the character is in
the upper or lower case we can do it in the same iteration by the one of the
two functions isupper() or islower() functions.

Just decide what format we prefere to work with

Asking for player1 for a word
asign the word in word1 variable

Step2:
How to compare the two scores?

The score of a word will be given by calling a function that calculate the
score, so this function will have an input and an output so the declaration of
the function will be like that:

int score(word);

So 
score1 = score(word1)
And 
score2 = score(word2)

if (score1 > score2)
{
printf("player1 won!\n");
}
else if (score1 < score2)
{
printf("Player2 won!\n");
}
else
{"Tide\n");
