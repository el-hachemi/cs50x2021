I had to write the steps into ea different file and describe the action step by
step.

It's really a good idea to write the action step by step!!!!

It's a must do!!!


The mario.c contain a pyramide that begin from the left
The mario_f.c contain a the same pyramide but that seem to begin from the
right, a tric made by adding spaces to each row.
The mario2.c contain the two pyramides with splited with two spaces between
them.
